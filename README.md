# Nest.js GraphQL Sample 

Working code (no DB) which creates a graphql endpoint for authors/posts data. 

This is the result from learning/implementing GraphQL as written in the nest.js docs.

## install

`npm install`

## run tests 

`npm run test`


Todo: 
- Figure out proper way to pass filtering/querying down to service level
- Create/Update/Delete entities
